## Learning Opportunity
This puzzle makes you split a string into substrings, replace a character of a string and convert it into floats. You also have to convert degrees into radians and use mathematical operations like square root or cosinus.

Finally you have to apply multiple computations (addition, multiplication...) on floating numbers.

 - Distances: https://www.codingame.com/learn/distance
 - Trigonometry: https://www.codingame.com/learn/trigonometry

## Statement
The goal of this exercise is to make you find the closest point to given geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Your program must print the associated location name.

In this puzzle you will play a lot with conversion (degree to radian, coordinates to distance, string to float).

## Story
Want to save lives? Good! So help us find the closest defibrillator from a given position in the city of Montpellier, France.

## Rules
The input data you require for your program is provided in text format.
This data is comprised of lines, each of which represents a defibrillator. Each defibrillator is represented by the following fields:
 - A number identifying the defibrillator
 - Name
 - Address
 - Contact Phone number
 - Longitude (degrees)
 - Latitude (degrees)
 - These fields are separated by a semicolon
